# Object Classification using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository contains code for a project on object classification using both traditional machine learning techniques with Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), as well as deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a classification model capable of accurately identifying objects in images. The project explores two different approaches: one using traditional machine learning techniques and another utilizing deep learning.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - The dataset used in this project is CIFAR-10, containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
   - Images are preprocessed by resizing them to 64x64 pixels and normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1].

2. **Machine Learning with SIFT and SVC:**
   - SIFT features are extracted from the preprocessed images.
   - An SVC classifier is trained on the extracted features.
   - Hyperparameters like C (regularization parameter) and gamma are optimized using grid search.
   - Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy.

3. **Deep Learning with CNN:**
   - A CNN architecture is designed with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
   - The dataset is split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets.
   - Transfer learning with a pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet50 is utilized.
   - Hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size are fine-tuned.
   - Model performance is evaluated on the testing set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Comparison and Analysis:**
   - The accuracy and computational efficiency of the SIFT-SVC model are compared with the CNN model.
   - Trade-offs between traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches are analyzed.
   - The scalability and generalizability of each method are discussed.
